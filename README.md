## Stage 2 - Basic Chatbot with FastAPI

### Stage Introduction

In this stage, we enhance our basic chatbot by **introducing FastAPI** as a backend service. Instead of making direct calls to the **OpenAI API** from the frontend, we now handle these requests through the FastAPI backend.

With this setup, when a user interacts with the **Streamlit frontend**, their request is sent to the **FastAPI backend**, which then calls the **OpenAI API** and returns the response.  

By **separating responsibilities**, the frontend focuses on **user interaction and session management**, while the backend handles **business logic and API calls**. This modular approach ensures that as long as the backend is running, the frontend can be replaced or updated with another technology **without affecting core functionality**.

### How to Get Started

#### **Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables**  
Store your **OpenAI API key** in a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY
```

#### **Step 2: Start the Backend**  
Before running the chatbot, start the **FastAPI** backend:

```bash
uvicorn backend:app --reload
```

#### **Step 3: Start the Frontend**  
Once the backend is running, launch the **Streamlit** app with:

```bash
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

> **Note:** Always start the backend first to ensure the chatbot functions properly.
